## Objective

The objective of this repository is to generate a stratification of Denmark based on Present climatic variables, soils variables and lidar variables (Average height and vegetation cover). # Vegetation height and density 
# Soil layer N
# Nature area   

# 150 points as close as possible and as similar as possible to 150 points

## Used packages

the packages needed to use this repo are:

- raster
- rworldxtra
- sf
- tidyverse

## layers used:

### climatic variables:

- CHELSA's bioclimatic variables

### Soil variables

### Lidar variables

Average height
